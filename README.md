# Vocabulary parser for Anki
The idea of this project is to use DeepL and Merriam-Webster for automated Anki card creation.


## ToDos
* make anki note modes accessible from writing script
* create datastructure to write anki cards from deepl or MW API response
* check if anki export and import can be automatized via cmd
* code backend database to sync anki collection with or alternatively .csv or .xlsx backend
* find a way to incorporate sound
